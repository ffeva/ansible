On your laptop
	gem install kitchen-ansible kitchen-puppet kitchen-vagrant serverspec

Your VM image should be >= Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) or CentOs 7.2
	This is because Ruby > 2 required
	But Ubuntu does not support busser-ansible properly
	On CentOS you will need to do an install of ruby and rubygems
		Which you will see in the ansible role
